# R56 Web

R56 is the project to collect pilot data for a Computerized Adaptive Test for Cognition (CAT-COG). This is the Javascript version of it for use in web browsers. 

# Tasks

R56 will have 9 tasks programmed into it, meant to probe 5 domains of cognitive function. The tasks are all designed to have variable difficulty, and to confound one another as little as possible.

## Episodic Memory

Episodic Memory describes a person's ability to recall a specific event. Generally it is probed by exposing a test subject to a number of stimuli, the exposure creating an event in the subject's memory. Then the subject is asked to recall information from the stimuli.

### Word Stimuli 

The subject is exposed to a set of English words. They are then asked to determine the truth or falsity of a number of simple math equations. Then they are given three sets of four English words, each containing one word from the original set, and asked to report which of those words appeared in the original set.
